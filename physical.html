				<p id="signature">-People who don't take their own advice</p>

				<p>
					Now unfortunately this will be one of the more lengthier problems that you will tackle.
					The physical self not ony requires a ton of attention and care but it is also a life long
					struggle that most people deal with. So much so that most people just elect to ignore it. 
					Some might say that why should they <q>Fix</q> what they look like? Why should they adjust themselves
					for the world? 
				</p>
				<p>
					Whilst having a sense of acceptance to ones own appearance no matter what people think can produce a 
					positive inwardly attitude towards one self, this can still be damaging to how people look and react towards 
					you. There is also a thin line between not caring what people think of you, and complete apathy towards taking
					care of ones hygene and other factor of appearance. 
				</p>

					<summary>Side Tangent: Stoic Philosophy</summary>
					<p>
						In the Stoic dispipline of Philosophy, A person should only produce a strong reaction if it is something that 
						they can have an affect on. If someting affects you but you cannot do anything about it, then needlessly worrying it about 
						solves no problem and in fact only produces more problems for you emotionally. Why am I bringing this up? Because in order to
						start having an effect towards your physical self, you need to understand what you can and can't do.
		
					</p>

				<p>
					
					Your phyiscal self is determined at birth by a genetic lottery which you or your parents, and their parents' parents did not
					have a hand on.

							Apparently back in the 1900s they did a lot of eugenics. Whilst there may be a case for eugenics being by <i><q>trustworthy</q></i> used 
							to prevent preventable genetic diseases, it can also be used for faciliating arguments for genocide
							and racial superiority. Topics which I am not equiped to handle. <br>
						</p>
						<p>
							So uhh, yeah. Fun fact I guess...

					Now back to what you can change. Anything about you that didn't cone with you at birth can be changed! (*with caveats.)
					If you feel that your are a Scrawny individual, or that you are a fat person then I have good news and bad news.
					Changing your appearance can be achievd through changing your lifestyle, habits or learning new skills such as 
					how to apply makeup or even learning how to dress yourself properly for the occasion. 
					It is possible to change youre overall physique by possesing the previous qualities mentioned. 
					<br><br>
					Now let us put them into use:
				</p>

				<h3>How to shapeshift:</h3>
				<p>
					Now changing your appearance depends on you goal. If you want to have a muscular olympiad 
					physique or if you want to be thinner than you currently are then we're going to have to set some goals.					
				</p>
				<p>
					If you can, go to the gym. From there you can probably get some advice from the gym bros there or if you can really afford
					it then you can even hire a trainer. Routines will differ depending on your goal whether it would be to thin up or to bulk up.
					What matters the most here is the effort you can exert and the gains that it will bring.
					If you are unable to go to a gym then maybe you can work out at home. Working out at home requires no equipment for
					the most part but of course you will have to improvise your way accordingly. Go to youtube.com for more details
					
				</p>
				<p>
					If your problem is not with your size or build but with your other appearance like how you look then 
					you can apply what I have already discussed.
					<br><br>
					Find Place or people to learn from &gt&gt Analyze your goals &gt&gt Improvise and change as you need.
					<br><br>
					If you want to learn make up or have grooming habits then you can also look up tutorials on youtube 
					or anywhere else in the internet. You can also ask people for help in order to get live feed back on 
					what you are doing. Experiment as well on you own as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					Have you looked at how you've dressed? Sometimes just getting a fresh color of clothes can change you.
					Escpecially for men who always wear the same combination of clothes until the day they die (Yeah I am calling
					my self out on this one).
				</p>

				<h2>Closing statement.</h2>
				<p>
					Remember, You can change, you can improve yourself. Never give up.
