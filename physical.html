					Now unfortunately this will be one of the more lengthier problems that you will tackle.
					The physical self not ony requires a ton of attention and care but it is also a life long
					struggle that most people deal with. So much so that most people just elect to ignore it. 
					Some might say that why should they <q>Fix</q> what they look like? Why should they adjust themselves
					for the world? 
				</p>
				<p>
					Whilst having a sense of acceptance to ones own appearance no matter what people think can produce a 
					positive inwardly attitude towards one self, this can still be damaging to how people look and react towards 
					you. There is also a thin line between not caring what people think of you, and complete apathy towards taking
					care of ones hygene and other factor of appearance. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In the Stoic dispipline of Philosophy, A person should only produce a strong reaction if it is something that 
					they can have an affect on. If someting affects you but you cannot do anything about it, then needlessly worrying it about 
					solves no problem and in fact only produces more problems for you emotionally. Why am I bringing this up? Because in order to
					start having an effect towards your physical self, you need to understand what you can and can't do.
				</p>

				<p>
					Your phyiscal self is determined at birth by a genetic lottery which you or your parents, and their parents' parents did not
					have a hand on. 
					<details>
						<summary>*Unless you're swedish</summary>
						<p>
							Apparently back in the 1900s they did a lot of eugenics. Whilst there may be a case for eugenics being by <i><q>trustworthy</q></i> used 
							to prevent preventable genetic diseases, it can also be used for faciliating arguments for genocide
							and racial superiority. Topics which I am not equiped to handle. <br>
						</p>
						<p>
							So uhh, yeah. Fun fact I guess...
						</p>
					</details>
				</p>
				<p>
					Now back to what you can change. Anything about you can be changed!* *with caveats.
					If you feel that your are a Scrawny individual, or that you are a fat person then I have good news and bad news. 
					It is possible to change youre overall physique by possesing four qualities:
				</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Proper knowledge</li>
						<li>Proper execution</li>
						<li>Routine</li>
						<li>Qualities</li>
					</ul>
				<p>
					And that is it. Whether it's about losing wieght 
					Whilst it might not seem like a lot, those three are both powerful qualities to have but are hard to come by.
					Let me start with Proper knowledge.
				</p>
				<h2>Proper knowledge</h2>
				<p>
					It is unwise to tackle any problem without any proper intel or background about that specific thing.
					Sometimes this can lead to silly mistakes or to life changing accidents. Proper knowledge is a must. 
					Know what to do, when to do, and how to do, as well as having one or more people helping you as either
					source of knowledge or as mentors count. Never be afraid to ask for help.
