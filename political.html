                    Back in my highschool days we used to joke that there were three stages in a class projects.
                    There was the first stage where everyone would suggest things but never really do anything. 
                    Then once enough time has past, the <i>leader</i>, or the poor soul that was singled out by the 
                    group, would start to assign tasks. and then finally, 48 hours before the deadline. The <i>elected</i>
                    leader suddenly turns into the most autocratic dicatator putting Hassan Sudein, Kim Jong Un and Gadaffi to Shame.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Don't really have much to say about this. As someone who has experienced being a group leader, either by being
                    forcefully thrust in to the position, or through tactical alliances where we agreed to share the burden of leading,
                    (in the end I had to step in as a leader full time), This really boils down to what works with you. If you are lucky
                    and your group mates are competent or rather, far exceed your capabilities, you can just watch rather than breathing
                    on their neck on whether or not they have completed their task. But be prepared for those with deliquencies in their tasks.
                    Have contingency in place in case they didn't do anything.

                        <b>DID YOU KNOW...</b> that within an ant colony, about 20 percent are always lazy? Even if you eliminate
                        the 20 percent of ants within the colony, the population of lazy ants will come back to that level. It seems
                        that lazyness is an inherent trait within a group of animals. There will always be people who are lazy in general
                        even if you eliminate them, that only produces a new set of lazy people within the group.                        
                    </p>

                    Source: I found this out from a Manga <br> but I also found a study from the internet here:

                    By the time I entered College, the number of people who are actually responsible have increased. It seems the 
                    people in highschool, those who don't do anything and expects to get credit, have either decided not to go to 
                    College or are doing something else. Not to say that they don't exist in college. But most of the time, people 
                    have actual good reason to not help and <q><i><b>Mercy is a quality not strained</b></i></q>. If you are a leader, then
                    act like it. Leaders don't threaten those who can't but help them as best they could, in a way that benefits the group.
