				<hr>
				<p> The Pandemic really shook our lives in many different ways.
                For me it broke a cycle of monotomy in my life and it was the first time I really had time to think about where my life was headed.
                It made me think of the ways my life could lead now that I was entering Senior High School. It was during the pandemic that I had first
                chosen ICT which led me to first take a serious interest in Programming. During the Pandemic I had all the time to research and better myself.
                I also learned some skills during and after thePandemic. Had the Pandemic never happened, who know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used to watch a now deleted channel during the Pandemic and the height of Lockdown here in Quezon City about two Youtuber trying to leave by the maximu
                    <q>Memento Mori</q>. I often think of the lesson I learned from those videos which were partially shaped by the Global Pandemic.It made me ask what was I doing 
                    with the Time that I was alloted with.
