									Oh what you thought I was gonna give you advice? That's a <i>"Blind man leads the blind"</i>

					But fret not cause it isn't too late. No matter how old you are, no matter who you are or where you are in life,
					there is always a choice open to you to be made. The first step is accepting what you lack and what you need to learn.
					The second step how ever is learning how to learn.
				</p>

				<h3>What you will need:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Proper knowledge</li>
					<li>Proper execution</li>
					<li>Routine</li>
					
				</ul>


			<h2>How to learn:</h1>
			
			<details>
				<summary id="knowledge"><b>Proper knowledge</b></summary>
				<p>
					It is unwise to tackle any problem without any proper intel or background about that specific thing.
					<br><b>Note: always tackle problems individually.</b> It is much easier to climb multiple hills than a one giant mountain
					Sometimes this can lead to silly mistakes or to life changing accidents. Proper knowledge is a must. 
					Know what to do, when to do, and how to do, as well as having one or more people helping you as either
					source of knowledge or as mentors count. <b>Never be afraid to ask for help.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, it is important to note that you only really need to learn the first 20 percent of anything in order to get 80 percent
					of the benefits. This is called the 20/80 rule. It stipulates that the first 80 percent of any skills  only require 20 percent
					of the work put in. The remaining 20 percent however requires 80 percent of the work already put in. You might also know this as 
					the law of deminishing return.
				</p>
				<p><b>TLDR: Isolate the Problem, Find out what you can do, and verify veracity of info.</b></p>
				
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary><b>Proper Exectution</b></summary>
				<p>
					Knowing is half the battle. With the intel acquired and verified it's time for putting paper into practice.
					Refer to the previous step for getting feed back on whether or not you are doing something correctly.
					This can be quite difficult at first but this is where the last qualities actually kicks in. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Always reflect on what you are doing and if you are doing it correctly. Don't be afraid to try out new things. 
					If you need to, record yourself while doing something. Or better yet ask someone you trust to observe you.
				</p>
				
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary><b>Routine</b></summary>
				<p>
					Dong something once won't really change anything. Doing it for a week won't yeild any results as well. You really have
					to commit yourself in order to learn how to change yourself. Now as someone with <abbr title="Attention Deficit/HyperActive Disorder">ADHD</abbr> I can tell you the struggles of 
					implementing a new routine. I won't lie to you I don't even have any sort of morning routine or anything of the sort because
					everyday I end up trying new things or if I have a task at hand I just force myself to get it over with (And then proceed
					to procastinate about it for the next 12 hours). But in order for change to become permanent it needs time. Don't be too harsh
					on yourself and be patient.

					<b>Some tips:</b>

					<ul>
						<li>Set some goals</li>
						<li>set Expectations</li>
						<li>Implement changed gradually</li>
						<li>If that doesn't work, Start big and then lower your goal until it becomes achievables</li>
					</ul>
